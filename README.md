# Network_Coverage_API

* execute `pip install requirements.txt` ( in virtual env is better)
  
* Use the import_data.py file to add coordinates and Operator_name to the csv file because coordinates calculations can be very slow so we don't want to make them on the API side.
  
*  start the API using the command `fastapi dev API.py `

*  access the API on your browser using the link `http://127.0.0.1:8000/network/{q}` where {q} is the address you want to check

*  HAVE FUN
